This module allows to search multi value on tree view at once.

Normal Case, you can search value one-by-one on tree view
We just add 'value1' -> enter -> add 'value2' -> enter -> add 'value3' -> enter ...
BUT If there are many value to search, it take a lot of time many
and you can copy value from excel to search value easily.

**Note**

In case there is spacebar in value, it will multi search mistake

i.e. 3 value is 'value 1', 'value 2' and 'value 3', you will search with {value 1 value 2 value 3} --> it will convert multi value to {value 1 2 3}

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Usage
=====

Add multi value inside {} and next value with spacebar

Example : {value1 value2 value3}
