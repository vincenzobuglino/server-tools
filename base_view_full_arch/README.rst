Displays view's fully combined architecture.

Primary views (ie: views that do not inherit from other views, or that are defined with
``mode == 'primary'``) will display the fully combined architecture including all the
inheriting views; inheriting views will display the fully combined architecture of the
ancestor view (recursively).

Especially useful for analysis, development and debug when having multiple inheriting
views.

This module's feature is not equivalent to using ``fields_view_get()``:

- ``fields_view_get()`` does not display the architecture of nested views (eg: sale
  orders' lines tree view, partners' children kanban view)
- ``fields_view_get()`` can only be accessed through the debug menu, which is not always
  available for views (eg: reports' templates)
- ``fields_view_get()`` applies to the views conditions generated by the Python code,
  making it harder to understand what's defined in the view's architecture and what's not

Usage
=====

Install the module, and a new tab will appear in the ``ir.ui.view`` form view to
display the fully combined architecture of the view.
